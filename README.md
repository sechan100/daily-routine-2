### Daily Routine

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4437d94c-bf5c-4269-83ee-b77ee3f4838a">

**Daily Routine** overcomes the limitations of checkboxes and todos that provide only one-time checks by introducing a new unit called **routine** for todos that need to be achieved daily. With routines, you can help complete todos that need to be repeated at specific intervals.

### Features

1. Create routines.
2. Provides the progress of all routines as a percentage.
3. Offers commands to check or uncheck all routines.
4. (Coming soon) Track records of desired routines and provide statistics.

## Creating a Routine

A routine is essentially no different from the existing checkboxes offered by Markdown. Unlike checkboxes that required clicking the exact box icon in preview mode, you can mark routines complete by clicking anywhere on the routine line. 

Routines can be written with the following syntax: `> - [ ]`

This is identical to writing a 'quoted checkbox.'

> Since using an entirely different syntax would prevent using the default checkbox features provided by Obsidian, a syntax identical to the quoted checkbox has been temporarily chosen. However, if problems arise in the long term, there is a willingness to change the syntax for writing routines.

## Displaying Routine Progress

You can see the progress of routines with an icon. This can be turned on/off in the settings.

## Check-All, Uncheck-All

Provides commands to check or uncheck all routines. This is useful for simple routine files not used in conjunction with the daily note.

## (Coming Soon) Routine Record Tracking and Statistics

This will be added later.
