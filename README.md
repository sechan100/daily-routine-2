## Features

### Routine Note
Routine Notes are Markdown files automatically generated daily, similar to Obsidian’s Daily Notes. All tasks are recorded within these notes, allowing you to manage them even without the Daily Routine plugin.

> Notes are stored in the `{custom-daily-routines}/notes` directory.

Routines are recurring tasks that can be scheduled for specific dates, weekdays, or daily execution.

### Todo
Todos function as standard one-time tasks, helping you keep track of specific tasks that don’t repeat.

### Calendar

The calendar displays tasks that include the `showOnCalendar` attribute, ensuring they appear on the designated dates. Both routines and todos can be displayed on the calendar.
